Explain the code execution based on the order of the messages logged in src/quiz/promise-2darray.txt.
 
The code execution of messages logged in src/quiz/promise-2darray.txt was as follows:
    Sum called ... 
    returning from sum
    Sum called ...    
    rejecting ...     
    returning from sum
    BAD INPUT: Expected array as input
    resolving ...
    45

sumPromise1 calls the sum2DArray function and logs:
    Sum called ... 
    returning from sum
Since a valid array is passed to the function, the setTimeout function is called causing the function to wait until the timer runs out to execute

sumPromise2 calls the sum2DArray function and logs:
    Sum called ...    
    rejecting ...     
    returning from sum
A valid array was not passed to the function, causing the promise to be rejected

Since the sumPromise2 was rejected, the .catch promise handler is executed and logs the expected error:
    BAD INPUT: Expected array as input

The code from the setTimeout function from sumPromise1 executes and resolves the sumPromise1:
    resolving ...

sumPromise1's .then handler is executed and logs the sum of the array.
    45
