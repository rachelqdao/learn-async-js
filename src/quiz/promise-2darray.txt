Explain the code execution based on the order of the messages logged in src/quiz/promise-2darray.txt.

just because we are doing a new promise it doesnt mean that the code inside is also running asyncronously

the promises run in different threads and do not print "in order", ex why they are interchanged in order
 -- any promise executes outside of the main thread
